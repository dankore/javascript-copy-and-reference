    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let team = players;
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // console.log(players, team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    let team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Adamu';
    
    let team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[0] = 'Dankore';
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 140, name: 'Adamu', age: 45 });
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    let cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.name = 'Adamu';

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
  let Adamu = {
    name: 'Adamu',
    age: 30,
    socials: {
      twitter: '@adamuMdankore',
      facebook: 'adamuMdankore'
    }
  }
  
  let clone = Object.assign({}, Adamu, {});
  
  //Poor man's deep clone
  let clone2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(Adamu));
  clone2.socials.facebook = '@Blah'
  
  console.log(clone2, Adamu);
